## TODO
- Players scan qr code and navigate to hacked website \
- Players do a directory scan of that website with a wordlist and discover a /admin page \
- Players try common credentials such as username: admin and password: password123! \
- When looking inside the admin panel, users discover a novnc shell page in which they can access the host device \
- Players try to find out how this machine got hacked and discover an ssh history from a specified ip address (some ssh log) \
- Players do an nmap scan and discover an ftp port (21) is open and allows anonymous access \
- Players do this to gain an ssh key pair so they now have access to the "hackers" pc \
- Players discover a bomb.o file which allegedly is responsible for the mass data deletion. \
- Upon solving the file, users discover that they are not on the real bomb.o \
- Players scan the provided ip address and brute force their way into the real pc and nullify the threat
